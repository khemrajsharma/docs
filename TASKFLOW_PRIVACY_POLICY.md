# Privacy Policy for TaskFlow

**Last Updated: May 21 2025**

Thank you for using TaskFlow ("App", "we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the App after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the App or make payments, including any in-app virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.

## COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:

### Personal Data

While using our App, we do not directly collect any personally identifiable information such as your name, shipping address, email address, or telephone number, or demographic information such as your age, gender, hometown, or interests, unless you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., through feedback or support requests).

### App Preferences Data

We collect information about your preferences within the App to enhance your user experience. This includes:

*   **Dark Theme Settings:** We store your preference for using a dark or light theme within the App.
*   **Dynamic Colors Settings:** If your device supports it (Android 12+), we store your preference for using dynamic colors based on your wallpaper.
*   **Notification Settings:** We store your preferences for receiving general notifications from the App.
*   **Reminder Notification Settings:** We store your preferences for receiving reminder notifications for your tasks.

This data is stored locally on your device and is used solely to customize your experience with the App. We do not transmit this information from your device.

### Derivative Data

Information our servers automatically collect when you access the App, such as your native actions that are integral to the App, as well as other interactions with the App and other users via server log files. For TaskFlow, this primarily relates to the storage and synchronization of your tasks and related data if cloud sync features are implemented in the future. Currently, all task data is stored locally on your device.

## USE OF YOUR INFORMATION

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:

*   Customize your user experience according to your preferences (e.g., theme, dynamic colors).
*   Deliver notifications and reminders as per your settings.
*   Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve your experience with the App.
*   Respond to product and customer service requests.
*   Enable user-to-user communications (if applicable).
*   Increase the efficiency and operation of the App.

## DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties.

We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:

### By Law or to Protect Rights

If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

### Third-Party Service Providers

We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance. As of the current version, TaskFlow primarily uses local storage and does not rely heavily on third-party service providers for core functionality that involves your personal data beyond what is necessary for the app to function on the Android platform (e.g., Google Play Services for notifications if implemented).

### Business Transfers

If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired by another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity. If we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may decline honor commitments we made in this Privacy Policy.

We are not responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal or sensitive data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party solicitations. If you no longer wish to receive correspondence, emails or other communications from third parties, you are responsible for contacting the third party directly.

## TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

### Cookies and Web Beacons

We do not use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, or other tracking technologies on the App for advertising or analytics purposes.

### Internet-Based Advertising

We do not partner with third-party ad networks or allow third-party advertisers to display advertising on the App.

## DATA SECURITY

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.

## DATA RETENTION

We will retain your information (app preferences) on your device as long as you use the App or until you manually clear the App's data or uninstall the App. Task data is also stored locally and managed by you.

## POLICY FOR CHILDREN

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.

## CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

## YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS

Depending on your region, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your data.

### Residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and UK

If you are a resident of the EEA or UK, you have certain data protection rights. We aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your Personal Data. If you wish to be informed what Personal Data we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us.

### California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the App, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the App. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the App, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our systems.
